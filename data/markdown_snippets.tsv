Mark J. Mulligan, MD, FIDSA, Director & Thomas S. Murphy Sr. Professor of Medicine & Microbiology (NYU Langone Vaccine Center; NYU Grossman School of Medicine/Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology),

With the recent Bird Flu (H5N1) outbreaks across the country, Brooklyn community leaders and residents have an opportunity to review the situation and assess the risk of potential further spread. After recounting the epidemiology (humans, birds, dairy cows, sea mammals, other species), clinical disease, and treatment, Dr. Mulligan will review his ongoing work on H5N1 vaccines, and any prevention methods that residents can use to stay healthy."
