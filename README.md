<h1>Brooklyn Community Board 2 Health, Environment & Social Services Agenda Explorer</h1>

<h2>Prepare to attend your first [BK CB2 HESS meeting](https://cbbrooklyn.cityofnewyork.us/cb2/all-committees/health-environment-social-services/) by looking up past meeting agendas.</h2>

Community boards are an important part of NYC's government, giving residents a voice in what goes on in their neighborhoods. I've been going to my community board's--Brooklyn Community Board 2--meetings for a while now, but I've often felt like I lacked context from previous meetings. What locations attract the most attention? What local businesses near me trying to do? What have been my community's major concerns?

So I made this site in order to go into these meetings prepared to understand and ask critical questions, and be a more engaged citizen in my local government.
